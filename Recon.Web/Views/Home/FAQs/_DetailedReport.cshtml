        In order to be listed in the reconciliation report, a VMS trip must follow the two following rules:<br />
        - the vessel must be licensed to fishe during the trip<br />
        - the trip must take place at some point within you EEZ<br />
        <br />
        However, the transit days are removed from the column VMS NB DAYS. So a licensed vessel transiting only through your EEZ during a trip will have its NB VMS DAYS at 0.
